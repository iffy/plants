- Do not fertilize within 2 months of first fall frost

### First year

- After 6 weeks, fertilize trees with 1lb nitrogen fertilizer
- In summer of first year, cut vigorous shoots.  One month later, cut to 3 wide-angled branches
- Water a good amount every 3 weeks (every 2 weeks when it's hotter)

### Second year

- 3/4lb N fertilizer once in spring, again in early summer
- early summer: cut back branches and shoots
